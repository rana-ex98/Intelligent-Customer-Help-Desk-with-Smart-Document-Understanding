# Intelligent-Customer-Help-Desk-with-Smart-Document-Understanding
Category : Artificial Intelligence 
1. Project Summary : 
  In this project, we use the typical customer care chatbot experience, but instead of relying on pre-determined responses,     the dialog provides a hook that can call out to other IBM Watson services for additional sources of information. In this       case, its ecobee3_userguide owner manual that has been uploaded to Watson Discovery. 
  
2. Project Requirements :
  i) Create a customer care dialog skill in Watson Assistant.  
  ii) Smart Document Understanding (SDU) to build an enhanced Watson Discovery collection. 
  iii) Create an IBM Cloud functions web action that allows Watson Assistant to post queries to Watson discovery.  
  iv) Build a web application with integration to all these services and deploy the same on IBM Cloud Platform.  
  
3. Functional Requirements: 
  step-1: The data source from external is annotated by using Watson Discovery Smart Document Understanding. 
  step-2: The user interacts with the back-end server through the application user interface. The front-end app user interface           is a chatbot that engages the user in a conversaton. 
  step-3: Dialog between the user and back-end server is coordinated using a Watson Assistant dialog skill. 
  step-4: If the user asks a question that falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, then a search query           is issued to the Watson Discovery service through a Watson Assistant search skill.
  
4. Technical Requirements : 
  i) Write the code in github account and clone the repository. 
  ii) Create Watson services. 
  iii) Configure Watson Discovery.  
  iv) Configure Watson Assistant.  
  v) Add Watson service credentials to environment file. 
  vi) Run the application. 
  
5. Software Requirements: 
  IBM Cloud  Node-RED (Flow-based development tool for visual programming developed by IBM).
